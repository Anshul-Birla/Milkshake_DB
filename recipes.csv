Super loaded Snickers milkshake!,"Ingredients
2 servings
3 1/2 snickers bars (normal size)
3 1/2 cup vanilla ice cream
2 cup of any kind of milk (full, skimmed, semi)
3 1/2 tsp nesquick chocolate milkshake powder
1 All the following are optional extras to be used as toppings. Caramel drizzle sauce, squirty cream, nuts /sweets.","Steps
Cut 3 of the snickers bars into small slices, about 1 or 2 cm thick. Cut the last half a snickers bar (... or put the whole bar in if you want a really luxurious treat!) into double the size slices of the previous slices you cut . This will ensure you have some chunkier pieces at the bottom of your shake(And who doesn't love those chunky bits?!? ) .
Add the milk, nesquick powder, 1 (just the one) cup of ice cream, and all but some of the chunkier pieces of the snickers bars, into the blender.
Blitz everything in the blender until smooth and creamy. Ensure the snickers bar is not in clumps at the bottom and is fully blended.
Once fully blended and smooth, add another cup and a half of ice cream (this will leave you with one cup of ice cream ) and briefly blend. Or pulse, if your blender has this function. Do not over blend, as this will make the consistency of the milkshake thinner.
Add the last of the snickers and blitz until you can hear/see that they are in small pieces of bite sized heaven. I like mine chunky, but blend to taste. Just before your pieces are your preferred size, stop blending and add the last cup of ice cream and pulse in, to keep it nice and thick.
And that's it! finish it off with the toppings of your choice. I like mine nice and simple... Although I never can say no to caramel drizzle! Anything goes! Add anything you like : cream, sauces, nuts, sweets, sprinkles, fruit, chocolate chips, and anything else you can think of!!! Enjoy!
Need a pick me up? Need a caffeine fix? Missing your coffee? Then add some kick start to your shake.... Make the milkshake as normal, but when adding the last cup of ice cream before you do so add a shot of espresso (which has been left to cool). Or if your out of espresso make up some of your usual instant (or otherwise) coffee, keep black, leave to cool, then add to milkshake and continue with recipe.
